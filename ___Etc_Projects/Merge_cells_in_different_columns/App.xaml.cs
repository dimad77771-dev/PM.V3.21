// Developer Express Code Central Example:
// How to merge cells in the GridControl
// 
// This example demonstrates how to achieve the merged cells effect in the
// GridControl. The main idea consists of stretching the top merged cell and
// showing it over other merged cells. For this purpose, the Panel.ZIndex and
// Margin properties are used.
// Please take special note that this example doesn't
// support editing cells. This example is designed for the DeepBlue theme and may
// need to be modified if you wish to use it in other themes.
// 
// You can find sample updates and versions for different programming languages here:
